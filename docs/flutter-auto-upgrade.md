# Flutter Auto-Upgrade GitHub Action

A comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that automatically checks for Flutter updates and critical dependency updates weekly, creating pull requests when updates are available.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Weekly Scheduled Checks**: Automatically runs every Sunday at 2 AM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions UI
- **Smart Version Detection**: Fetches latest stable Flutter release from GitHub API
- **Dependency Updates**: Checks for dio and http package updates via pub.dev API
- **Intelligent Change Detection**: Only creates PRs when actual changes exist after upgrade
- **Robust Upgrade Process**: Uses fallback to `flutter upgrade --force` if normal upgrade fails

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Multi-Package Support**: Handles Flutter, dio, and http updates independently or combined
- **Automatic Deprecation Fixes**: Applies `dart fix --apply` to handle breaking changes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Runs `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` after upgrade
- **Detailed PR Creation**: Creates informative pull requests with upgrade summaries
- **Auto-Labeling**: Automatically labels PRs with relevant tags
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with detailed logging

## 📁 File Structure

The workflow and related files:
```
.github/workflows/flutter-upgrade.yml  # Main workflow file
.flutter-version-tracked               # Tracks processed Flutter versions
```

### Version Tracking File
The `.flutter-version-tracked` file contains the last processed Flutter version:
```
3.32.8
```
This prevents duplicate upgrade attempts and ensures the workflow only runs for new releases.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Schedule Configuration
The workflow runs on a weekly schedule:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Run every Sunday at 2 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering
```

### Permissions Required
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write      # For creating branches and commits
  pull-requests: write # For creating and labeling PRs
```

### Environment Variables
The workflow automatically sets these environment variables:
- `BRANCH_NAME`: Name of the upgrade branch (e.g., `flutter/auto-upgrade-3.32.8-20241205-143052`)
- `TRACKED_VERSION`: Previously processed Flutter version from `.flutter-version-tracked`
- `INSTALLED_VERSION`: Current Flutter version installed in the CI environment
- `LATEST_VERSION`: Latest available Flutter stable version
- `DIO_VERSION`: Current dio package version in the project
- `HTTP_VERSION`: Current http package version in the project
- `LATEST_DIO_VERSION`: Latest available dio package version
- `LATEST_HTTP_VERSION`: Latest available http package version

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Smart Version Detection
```bash
# Check for tracked Flutter version
if [ -f ".flutter-version-tracked" ]; then
  TRACKED_VERSION=$(cat .flutter-version-tracked)
  echo "Previously tracked Flutter version: $TRACKED_VERSION"
else
  # Fallback to current installed version
  TRACKED_VERSION=$(flutter --version | head -n 1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
  echo "No tracked version found, using current: $TRACKED_VERSION"
fi

# Get latest stable version from GitHub API (macOS compatible)
LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/flutter/flutter/releases | grep '"tag_name"' | grep -v 'pre' | head -1 | cut -d '"' -f 4)

# Fallback if API fails
if [ -z "$LATEST_VERSION" ]; then
  LATEST_VERSION=$(flutter --version | head -n 1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+')
  echo "Warning: Could not fetch latest version from GitHub, using installed version"
fi

# Compare tracked vs latest (only upgrade if truly new)
if [ "$TRACKED_VERSION" != "$LATEST_VERSION" ]; then
  echo "Upgrade available: $TRACKED_VERSION -> $LATEST_VERSION"
else
  echo "Flutter is already up to date (tracked: $TRACKED_VERSION)"
fi

# Get current dio and http package versions
DIO_CURRENT=$(grep "dio:" pubspec.yaml | sed 's/.*: \^//')
HTTP_CURRENT=$(grep "http:" pubspec.yaml | sed 's/.*: \^//')

# Get latest versions from pub.dev API
DIO_LATEST=$(curl -s https://pub.dev/api/packages/dio | jq -r '.latest.version')
HTTP_LATEST=$(curl -s https://pub.dev/api/packages/http | jq -r '.latest.version')
```

### 2. Robust Upgrade Process
```bash
# Try normal upgrade first, fallback to force upgrade
if ! flutter upgrade; then
  echo "Normal upgrade failed, attempting force upgrade..."
  flutter upgrade --force
fi

# Update dio and http packages
dart pub upgrade dio:$LATEST_DIO_VERSION http:$LATEST_HTTP_VERSION
```

### 3. Automatic Deprecation Fixes
```bash
# Check and apply automatic fixes
dart fix --dry-run
dart fix --apply
```

### 4. Version Tracking Update
```bash
# Update tracked version after successful upgrade
if [ "$UPGRADE_AVAILABLE" == "true" ]; then
  echo "$LATEST_VERSION" > .flutter-version-tracked
  echo "Updated tracked Flutter version to $LATEST_VERSION"
fi
```

### 5. Change Detection
```bash
git add .
if git diff --staged --quiet; then
  echo "has_changes=false"
  echo "No changes detected after Flutter upgrade"
else
  echo "has_changes=true"
  echo "Changes detected after Flutter upgrade"
fi
```

### 6. Quality Assurance
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter doctor
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Upgrade Failures
- Primary: `flutter upgrade`
- Fallback: `flutter upgrade --force`
- Both failures are logged with detailed error messages

### Branch Conflicts
- **Unique branch naming**: Timestamps prevent naming conflicts
- **Remote cleanup**: Automatically deletes conflicting remote branches
- **Force push fallback**: Handles edge cases with force push strategy

### Permission Errors
- **Label creation**: Gracefully handles insufficient permissions for labeling
- **Repository access**: Continues workflow even if some operations fail
- **Non-critical failures**: Uses `continue-on-error` for optional steps

### API Failures
- **GitHub API**: Fallback to installed Flutter version if API fails
- **pub.dev API**: Graceful degradation for dependency version checks
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Fixed macOS grep issues with universal commands

### JavaScript Errors
- **Template literals**: Fixed syntax errors in PR creation script
- **Variable interpolation**: Proper escaping and variable handling
- **Error boundaries**: Try-catch blocks for non-critical operations

## 📊 Workflow Conditions

| Scenario | Flutter Update | Dependency Updates | Action Taken |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| No updates (versions match tracking) | ❌ | ❌ | Log message, skip |
| New Flutter release (tracking outdated) | ✅ | ❌ | Create Flutter upgrade PR |
| Dependencies only | ❌ | ✅ | Create dependency update PR |
| Combined updates | ✅ | ✅ | Create combined upgrade PR |
| Updates but no file changes | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | Log "no changes", no commit |
| Already processed version | ❌ | ❌ | Skip (smart tracking prevents duplicates) |
| API errors | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Use fallback versions, continue |
| Branch conflicts | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Force push with timestamp branch |
| Permission errors | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Continue without labels, workflow succeeds |

## 📦 Supported Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
The workflow currently monitors:
- **Flutter SDK**: Latest stable releases
- **dio**: HTTP client for network requests
- **http**: Standard HTTP client

### Why These Dependencies?
For the AppDynamics Flutter plugin:
- **dio**: Critical for `TrackedDioInterceptor` functionality
- **http**: Used in `TrackedHttpClient` for network tracking
- **Flutter**: Core framework compatibility

### Adding More Dependencies
To monitor additional packages, extend the dependency checking step:
```yaml
# Check new package version
NEW_PACKAGE_CURRENT=$(grep "new_package:" pubspec.yaml | sed 's/.*: \^//')
NEW_PACKAGE_LATEST=$(curl -s https://pub.dev/api/packages/new_package | jq -r '.latest.version')

# Add to update logic
if [ "$NEW_PACKAGE_CURRENT" != "$NEW_PACKAGE_LATEST" ]; then
  echo "New package update available: $NEW_PACKAGE_CURRENT -> $NEW_PACKAGE_LATEST"
  DEPS_AVAILABLE=true
fi
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Workflow Not Running
- Check if the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Verify the cron syntax is correct
- Ensure repository has Actions enabled
- Check if `.flutter-version-tracked` file exists (auto-created on first run)

#### Version Tracking Issues
- **Missing tracking file**: Auto-created on first workflow run
- **Incorrect tracked version**: Manually edit `.flutter-version-tracked` if needed
- **Stuck on old version**: Delete tracking file to force re-detection

#### Branch Conflicts
- **Duplicate branch names**: Fixed with timestamp-based naming
- **Push failures**: Handled automatically with force push fallback
- **Stale branches**: Automatically cleaned up by workflow

#### PR Creation Fails
- **JavaScript errors**: Fixed template literal syntax issues
- **Permission errors**: Made label creation optional (continues on failure)
- **Branch conflicts**: Resolved with unique branch naming

#### Label Addition Fails
- **Permission errors**: Workflow continues successfully
- **Missing labels**: Can be added manually if needed
- **Repository restrictions**: Non-critical, doesn't affect functionality

#### Tests Fail After Upgrade
- Review Flutter breaking changes in release notes
- Check if manual fixes are needed beyond automatic ones
- Consider updating dependencies that may be incompatible

#### No Changes Detected
- This is normal if Flutter upgrade doesn't change any files
- Indicates your project is already compatible with the new version
- No action needed, workflow is working correctly
